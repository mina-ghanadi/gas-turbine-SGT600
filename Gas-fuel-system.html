    <h1>
        Gas fuel system
    </h1>
    <h3>
        Purpose of the system
    </h3>
    <p>
        The purpose of the gas fuel system is to supply gas fuel of correct flow to the gas turbine burners 
during turbine start and operation and to supply the ignition gas system with ignition gas 
That is:
To supply the gas turbine with gas fuel.
To control the fuel flow at start-up, during operation and stop.
Activate a fast shut-off of the fuel supply in case of a turbine trip in order to prevent damage to the machinery.
To check tightness of fuel shut-off valves.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Start up
    </h3>
    <p>
        
The gas fuel system is automatically started by the gas turbine start sequence. The
ventilation and lubricating oil systems shall be in operation. 
Start of the gas fuel system includes the following steps:
The fuel isolation valve opens.
Stroke test of the gas fuel control valves are also performed. 
Leakage test of the gas fuel quick shut-off valves and the intermediate ventilation valve is automatically performed.

    </p>
    <h3>Turbine stop</h3>
    <p>
        During turbine stop, the load/speed is ramped down. 
When the load/speed has reached a pre-set value, 
the turbine is tripped. Thereby the fuel shut-off valves 
close and the control valves are set to minimum 
position. Simultaneously the isolation valve will close, 
the ventilation valve MBP10AA230 opens and 
ventilates the trapped gas between the shut-off valves. 

    </p>
    <h3>Combustion Chamber</h3>
    <p>
        The SGT-600 low emission combustion 
	system is using the Siemens EV-burners, which are working according to the lean premixed combustion principle when operating on gaseous fuels.
