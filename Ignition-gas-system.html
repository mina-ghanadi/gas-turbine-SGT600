    <h1>Ignition gas system</h1>
    <h3>Purpose of the system</h3>
    <p>The purpose of the system is to supply the ignition gas burner with the right amount of gas and air so the main flame can be ignited. The purpose of the system is also to supply burner no. 6 
        with gas during ignition of the 
        gas turbine. 
    </p>
    <h3>
        General description of the system 
    </h3>
    <p>
        Gas for the ignition gas unit is supplied from main gas system or  from gas bottles (Propane).
The gas then flows through a pressure reducing valve, two shut-off valves, one flow control valve and an orifice into the ignition burner. 

Instrument air enters the system from an external supply system and flows through one manual shut off valve, a pressure reducing valve, a flow control 
valve and two-shut off valves to supply the ignition burner with air. Burner No. 6 is supplied with gas that flows through one 
manual control valve/orifice, two automatic 
shut-off valves and into burner no. 6.
