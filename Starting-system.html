    <h1>MBJ starting system</h1>
    <h3>MBJ Starter motor system</h3>
    <p>Purpose of the system
        The electrical starting system accelerates the gas generator to purging/ignition speed. After ignition, 
        the gas generator is accelerated to self-sustaining speed.
        During shut down, that is after the combustor is shut-off, the system keeps the gas generator running 
        at turning speed for cooling purposes
        </p>
        <p>Design criterias and standards 
            Direction of shaft rotation -		Anti-clockwise looking contraflow
            Dimensioning data
            Drive torque requirements -		700 Nm at 2300 rpm
            Nominal speed range -		
            0 - 5000 rpm.
            Max. speed -		
            5800 rpm during one minute.
            
            Installation 
            The starting system is installed 
            in front of the gas generator.
