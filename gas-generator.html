    <h1>Gas Generator</h1>
    <p>The gas generator generates a flow of pressurized hot gas, driving the power turbine.</p>
    <img src="" title="SGT-600 HMI" />
    <h3>General description of system</h3>
    <p>The SGT-600 gas turbine operates in  a simple open cycle with straight air and gas flow through the turbine.
        It divided into two main sections, the gas generator and the power turbine. The two main sections are not mechanically interconnected, so 
        the gas generator speed is determined by the output of the unit as well as ambient consitions,witch allows a wider control range at sustained efficiency.
        the gas generator comprises the compressor, the cumbustion chamber and the compressor turbine.

    <h3>Compressor</h3>
    <p>The inlet casing consists of an outer and an inner casing, which directs the incoming air to the compressor first stage 
        The inner casing contains bearing housing no.1 and the SSS-clutch, connecting/disconnecting the starting motor to the gas generator rotor. 
    </p>

    <h3>Intake</h3>
    <p>The inner casing is connected to the outer casing via four hollowed profile rods. The rods contain lube oil and seal air pipes as well as instrumentation cables (speed, vibration, axial position, bearing temperature, phase angle).
        The inlet casing is bolted to the compressor casing.

    <h3>IGV Stepper motor</h3>
    <p>
        The guide vanes of the first two stages are of the variable geometry type, actuated by a spindle control mechanism and an AC-servo.

    </p>
    <h3>Compressor Rotor</h3>
    <p>
        The compressor rotor is solid, built up from a number of fully electron beam welded discs and an inter-mediate shaft. 
The compressor blades are fitted in the discs by dove tail attachment.
The blades and vanes are coated for corrosion protection.
