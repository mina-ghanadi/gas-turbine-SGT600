    <hr/>
    <h2 class="com">Compressor</h2>
    <p>A 10 stage axial-flow compressor is used to compressed the air.
        The compressor consists of three major parts. Two low-pressure sections with two and three stages, respectively, and one high-pressure section with 5 stages.<br/>
        To control the air flow to the compressor, the engine equipped with 2 variable guide vane stages(stages 0 and 1). These are of the variable geometry type,actuated via a spindle control mechanism and a variable speed electric motor.<br/>
        The rotor assemblies are built up of several electron-beam welded disks and an intermediate shaft is welded on to the rotor.<br/>
        A diffused section after the compressor functions to decelerate the compressor discharge air flow to maintain pressure and to direct the air into the combustion chamber.

        <h3 class="com">Compressor Casing (HG 4250)</h3>
        <p>This HG(head group) is the biggest stationery casing in the Gas generator and this casing is effecting many measurements during assembly. Mentioned HG has a role for acting as a cover for all inside parts and casings.<br/>
            HG 4250 is the place that bleed valves are assembling. And also base of IGV is assembled in this HG.
             this part is a casting part that should be machined properly. If you look to the Gas generator you will notify that many internal casings are assembled inside of this HG.<br/>
            
            During transportation of  Gas turbine you need some place to connect special tool for  lifting of unit. HG 4250 is the place that you can connect one part of lifting tool.
            
            one side of this HG is HG 4210 and another side is HG4310. it means that this HG is very important in working of Gas Turbine.

        <h3 class="com">Front compressor carrier (HG 4251)</h3>
        <p>Gas Generator is a axial compressor, it means that you should have some rotary blades and also stationary vanes. This HG is the basement for first 3 stages of the compressor.<br/>
            This HG has two types of vanes, fixed vanes that known as CGV, and variable vanes that known as VGV. this VGV vanes works with actuator, this combination make IGV system. That its is very important during change of speed of the rotor or avoiding of purge in the compressor.<br/>
            Also remember that after some ours of running of engine you have to check tip clearance of blades with this casing with using filler gauge.<br/>
            Centre of this casing its exactly in the center of rotor.

        <p>After HG 4251, this HG is located, and stages 3,4,5 of the fixed vanes are assembled . Tip clearance of blades and casing is little tighter that HG4251.<br/>
            Another important matter for this HG is connecting type with the HG 4250. this part its not direct bolted to HG4250, by using 3 ex center shafts , this HG connect to the HG4250. this ex center shafts can align casing with rotor. So after some hours of working of Gas Turbine you should measure tip clearance and align this casing with the rotor.<br/>
            All of the vanes are fixed to the casing in this HG. And there is not any IGV system in this casing. <br/>
            Between this HG and HG4251, there is a cavity that air goes out and when bleed valves are open , goes out from the casing. This part is working in the cold section of the turbine.<br/>
            Also in the end of this HG there another cavity that most part of leaking air will use for cooling guide vanes in stage 3 of Power turbine. And center of this HG is in the center of rotor.

        <p>In compressor some times you need to manage volume of the air . So you need to have valves that let the air goes out from compressor system.<br/>
            For this manner in SGT 600 we have two bleed valves, one of the working as  open or close valve, but another is a controllable valve.<br/>
            
            Place of mentioned valves are in top of HG 4250. in SGT 600 gas turbine , this valves pass the air from compressor to inlet air.<br/>

        <p>For running the gas Turbine we need to have fuel. This fuel should have needed pressure and also needed mass flow. This special mass flow is controlled by nozzles. <br>
            This nozzles are inside of this HG. Inside of HG 5051 there is two passage for main fuel and pilot fuels. <br>
            
            SGT 600 Siemens gas turbine can run with liquid fuel also, at that time you have to use dual fuel injectors. In this type of injectors you will have two more passages, one for liquid fuel and one for water. <br>
            
            In some early SGT600 for having low nox and also for having cold flame during usage of gas turbine  they use water and also one manifold for water. <br>
            
            Nowadays after improvement of materials in the combustion chamber water its not used.
