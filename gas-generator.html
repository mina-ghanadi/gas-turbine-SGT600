    <div id="clutch">
        <h3 class="Inlet">Clutch (HG 5605)</h3>
        <p><strong>Basic Principles of Operation: </strong><br/>
            The initials “SSS” denote the 'Synchro-Self-Shifting‘ action of the clutch, whereby the clutch teeth are phased and then automatically shifted axially into engagement when rotating at precisely the same speed. The clutch disengages as soon as the input speed slows down
             relative to the output speed.<br/>
             The basic operating principle of the SSS Clutch can be compared to the action of a nut screwed on to a  bolt. If the bolt rotates with the nut free, the nut will rotate with the bolt. If the nut is prevented from rotating while the bolt continues to turn, the nut will move in a straight line along the bolt.<br/>
             In an SSS Clutch the input shaft (E) has helical splines (D) which correspond to the thread of the bolt. Mounted on the helical splines is a sliding component (C) which simulates the nut. In the diagram, the sliding component has external clutch teeth (B) at one end, and external
             ratchet teeth (G) at the other.<br/>
     
             When the input shaft rotates, the sliding component rotates with it until a ratchet tooth contacts the tip of a pawl (A) on the output clutch ring (F) to prevent rotation of the sliding component relative to the output clutch ring. <br/>
             As the input shaft continues to rotate, the sliding component will move axially along the helical splines of the input shaft. When a ratchet tooth is in contact with a pawl tip, the clutch engaging teeth are perfectly aligned for
             inter-engagement and thus will pass smoothly into mesh
             in a straight line path. As the sliding component moves along the input shaft,
             the pawl passes out of contact with the ratchet tooth, allowing the clutch teeth to come into flank contact and continue the engaging travel. Note that the only load on the pawl is that required to shift the lightweight sliding component along the helical splines.<br/>
     
            Driving torque from the input shaft will only be transmit-ted when the sliding component completes its travel by contacting an end stop on the input shaft, with the clutch teeth fully engaged and the pawls unloaded ,When a nut is screwed against the head of a bolt, no external thrust is produced. Similarly when the sliding component of an SSS Clutch reaches its end stop and
             the clutch is transmitting driving torque, no external thrust loads are produced by the helical splines. Where necessary, an oil dashpot is incorporated in the
             end stop to cushion the clutch engagement. If the speed of the input shaft is reduced relative to the output shaft, the torque on the helical splines will re-
             verse. This causes the sliding component to return to the disengaged position and the clutch will overrun.<br/>
             At high overrunning speeds, pawl ratcheting is prevented by a combination of centrifugal and hydrodynamic effects acting on the pawls.
             The basic SSS Clutch can operate continuously engaged or overrunning at maximum speed without wear occurring.

    <p>A 10 stage axial-flow compressor is used to compressed the air.
        The compressor consists of three major parts. Two low-pressure sections with two and three stages, respectively, and one high-pressure section with 5 stages.<br/>
        To control the air flow to the compressor, the engine equipped with 2 variable guide vane stages(stages 0 and 1). These are of the variable geometry type,actuated via a spindle control mechanism and a variable speed electric motor.<br/>
        The rotor assemblies are built up of several electron-beam welded disks and an intermediate shaft is welded on to the rotor.<br/>
        A diffused section after the compressor functions to decelerate the compressor discharge air flow to maintain pressure and to direct the air into the combustion chamber.

             this part is a casting part that should be machined properly. If you look to the Gas generator you will notify that many internal casings are assembled inside of this HG.<br/>
            
            During transportation of  Gas turbine you need some place to connect special tool for  lifting of unit. HG 4250 is the place that you can connect one part of lifting tool.

            This HG has two types of vanes, fixed vanes that known as CGV, and variable vanes that known as VGV. this VGV vanes works with actuator, this combination make IGV system. That its is very important during change of speed of the rotor or avoiding of purge in the compressor.<br/>
            Also remember that after some ours of running of engine you have to check tip clearance of blades with this casing with using filler gauge.<br/>
            Centre of this casing its exactly in the center of rotor.

So after some hours of working of Gas Turbine you should measure tip clearance and align this casing with the rotor.<br/>
            All of the vanes are fixed to the casing in this HG. And there is not any IGV system in this casing. <br/>
            Between this HG and HG4251, there is a cavity that air goes out and when bleed valves are open , goes out from the casing. This part is working in the cold section of the turbine.<br/>
