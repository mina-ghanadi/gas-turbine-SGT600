    <h1>Gas Generator (GG)</h1>
    <p>The gas generator generates a flow of pressurized hot gas, driving the power turbine.It is consist of 4 main parts: Inlet, Compressor, Cumbustion chamber and Compressor rotor.</p>

    <hr/>
   
    <h2>Inlet</h2>
    <p>The inlet casing consists of an outer and an inner casing, which directs the incoming air to the compressor first stage 
        The inner casing contains bearing housing no.1 and the SSS-clutch, connecting/disconnecting the starting motor to the gas generator rotor. 
    </p>
    
    <h3>Intake</h3>
    <p>The inner casing is connected to the outer casing via four hollowed profile rods. The rods contain lube oil and seal air pipes as well as instrumentation cables (speed, vibration, axial position, bearing temperature, phase angle).
        The inlet casing is bolted to the compressor casing.

    <h3>IGV Stepper motor</h3>
    <p>
        The guide vanes of the first two stages are of the variable geometry type, actuated by a spindle control mechanism and an AC-servo.

    </p>
    <h3>Compressor Rotor</h3>
    <p>
        The compressor rotor is solid, built up from a number of fully electron beam welded discs and an inter-mediate shaft.
The compressor blades are fitted in the discs by dove tail attachment.
The blades and vanes are coated for corrosion protection. 

    </p>
    <hr/>
    <h2>Compressor</h2>
    <p>A 10 stage axial-flow compressor is used to compressed the air.
        The compressor consists of three major parts. Two low-pressure sections with two and three stages, respectively, and one high-pressure section with 5 stages.<br/>
        To control the air flow to the compressor, the engine equipped with 2 variable guide vane stages(stages 0 and 1). These are of the variable geometry type,actuated via a spindle control mechanism and a variable speed electric motor.<br/>
        The rotor assemblies are built up of several electron-beam welded disks and an intermediate shaft is welded on to the rotor.<br/>
        A diffused section after the compressor functions to decelerate the compressor discharge air flow to maintain pressure and to direct the air into the combustion chamber.

        <h3>Compressor Casing (HG 4250)</h3>
        <p>This HG(head group) is the biggest stationery casing in the Gas generator and this casing is effecting many measurements during assembly. Mentioned HG has a role for acting as a cover for all inside parts and casings.<br/>
            HG 4250 is the place that bleed valves are assembling. And also base of IGV is assembled in this HG.
             this part is a casting part that should be machined properly. If you look to the Gas generator you will notify that many internal casings are assembled inside of this HG.<br/>
            
            During transportation of  Gas turbine you need some place to connect special tool for  lifting of unit. HG 4250 is the place that you can connect one part of lifting tool.
            
            one side of this HG is HG 4210 and another side is HG4310. it means that this HG is very important in working of Gas Turbine.

        <h3>Front compressor carrier (HG 4251)</h3>
        <p>Gas Generator is a axial compressor, it means that you should have some rotary blades and also stationary vanes. This HG is the basement for first 3 stages of the compressor.<br/>
            This HG has two types of vanes, fixed vanes that known as CGV, and variable vanes that known as VGV. this VGV vanes works with actuator, this combination make IGV system. That its is very important during change of speed of the rotor or avoiding of purge in the compressor.<br/>
            Also remember that after some ours of running of engine you have to check tip clearance of blades with this casing with using filler gauge.<br/>
            Centre of this casing its exactly in the center of rotor.
            </p>

    <div id="CenterCompressorCarrier">
        <h3>Center compressor carrier (HG 4252)</h3>
        <p>After HG 4251, this HG is located, and stages 3,4,5 of the fixed vanes are assembled . Tip clearance of blades and casing is little tighter that HG4251.<br/>
            Another important matter for this HG is connecting type with the HG 4250. this part its not direct bolted to HG4250, by using 3 ex center shafts , this HG connect to the HG4250. this ex center shafts can align casing with rotor. So after some hours of working of Gas Turbine you should measure tip clearance and align this casing with the rotor.<br/>
            All of the vanes are fixed to the casing in this HG. And there is not any IGV system in this casing. <br/>
            Between this HG and HG4251, there is a cavity that air goes out and when bleed valves are open , goes out from the casing. This part is working in the cold section of the turbine.<br/>
            Also in the end of this HG there another cavity that most part of leaking air will use for cooling guide vanes in stage 3 of Power turbine. And center of this HG is in the center of rotor.

        <h3>Rear compressor carrier (HG 4253)</h3>
        <p>Last part of the compressor internal casings is HG4253. and after it, we have hot section parts. Stages 6,7,8 ,9,10 are located in this HG. And connection with the Hg 4250 is ex center shafts.<br/>
            Tip clearance between rotor blades and casing here is minimum value and if you have vibration in the rotor out of controlled value , you can see sign of this value as scratching of casing here. .<br/>
            
            Length of the blades here is minimum value and blades in this place are very brittle. .<br/>
            
            This HG from end side is connected with HG4310.

    <div id="bleedValves">
        <h3>Bleed Valves (HG 5261)</h3>
        <p>In compressor some times you need to manage volume of the air . So you need to have valves that let the air goes out from compressor system.<br/>
            For this manner in SGT 600 we have two bleed valves, one of the working as  open or close valve, but another is a controllable valve.<br/>
            
            Place of mentioned valves are in top of HG 4250. in SGT 600 gas turbine , this valves pass the air from compressor to inlet air.<br/>
            
            This HG containing solenoid valves , air ducts , and small pipes. We call air ducts HG5262
