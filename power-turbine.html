    <h3>MBB Power Turbine System</h3>
    <p>General description of the system 
        The SGT-600 gas turbine operates in a simple open cycle with straight air and gas flow through the turbine. 
        
        It is divided into two main sections, the gas generator and the power turbine.
        Dimensioning data
Pressure ratio 3.52:1 at ISO-conditions
Nominal speed 7700 rpm
(MD speed	 3850 ï€­ 8085 rpm)

    <h3>PT- rotor</h3>
    <p>The power turbine rotor is solid, built up from two discs and a rotor shaft. The rotor is fully electron
        beam welded. The PT blades are fitted in fir-tree grooves and have shrouds to minimize the 
        interstage gas leakage. The rotor blades as well as the guide vanes are precision cast.

    <h3>PT- stator</h3>
    <p>The PT stator carries two guide vane stages. The first guide vane stage is permanently adjustable to obtain optimum efficiency at various climate conditions. The vanes in the first stage are also hollow to transport cooling air to the turbine disc. 
        The stator surfaces above the blade tips are provided with honeycomb seals. Honeycomb is an abradable seal, which can withstand a blade tip rubbing.

    <h3>Power Turbine casing (PT)</h3>
    <p>The turbine casing houses the power turbine stages. The turbine casing is bolted to the diffusor casing. The purpose of the diffusor is to increasing the pressure ratio across the power turbine. The bearing housings are attached to the diffusor casing.

        The exhaust casing surrounds the greater part of the diffusor casing and directs the exhaust gases to the outlet duct. The casing is designed to provide a minimum back pressure, which is important in order to not affect the power output.

    <h3>Bearings</h3>
    <p>The bearings are of tilting pad design with a directed lubrication system.
        The bearings are equipped with temperature sensors and vibration transducers.
        Two journal bearings, no. 3 and 4, numbered from the inlet to the exhaust carries the power turbine. Bearing no. 3 is a journal bearing and number 4 are a combined thrust and journal bearing.
